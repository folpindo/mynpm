gulp-intermediate [![status](https://api.travis-ci.org/robwierzbowski/gulp-intermediate.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/robwierzbowski/gulp-intermediate)&nbsp;[![dependencies](https://david-dm.org/robwierzbowski/gulp-intermediate.svg)](https://david-dm.org/robwierzbowski/gulp-intermediate)\n\n> A gulp helper for tools that need files on disk.\n\nSome tools require access to files on disk instead of working with `stdin` and `stdout` (e.g., [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Ruby Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)). `gulp-intermediate` is a convenience plugin that writes the current stream to a temporary directory, lets you run commands on the file system, and pushes the results back into the pipe.\n\n**NOTE:** Writing intermediate files to disk is counter to the gulp philosophy. If possible, use a tool that works with streams. Use gulp-intermediate only if other (better) options aren't available.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save-dev gulp-intermediate\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar spawn = require('child-process').spawn;\nvar intermediate = require('gulp-intermediate');\n\ngulp.task('default', function () {\n  return gulp.src('app/**/*.jade')\n    .pipe(intermediate({ output: '_site' }, function (tempDir, cb) {\n      // Run a command on the files in tempDir and write the results to\n      // the specified output directory.\n      var command = spawn('a_command', ['--dest', '_site'], {cwd: tempDir});\n      command.on('close', cb);\n    }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));\n});\n```\n\nFor more examples see [recipes.md](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/gulp-intermediate/blob/master/recipes.md).\n\n## API\n\n### intermediate(options, process)\n\n#### options\n\n##### output\n\nType: `string`  \nDefault: `'.'`\n\nThe directory read back into the stream when processing is finished. Relative to `tempDir`.\n\n##### container\n\nType: `string`  \nDefault: random uuid\n\nThe directory that files are written to, relative to the operating system's temporary directry. Defaults to a unique random directory on every run.\n\nThe container is emptied before every run. \n\n#### process(tempDir, cb, [fileProps])\n\nType: `function`  \nRequired  \n\nRun your commands inside the `process` callback. `process` comes with three arguments:\n\n- `tempDir`: The absolute path to the directory containing your temporary files. If using `spawn` you may want to set the `cwd` option to `tempDir`.\n- `cb`: A callback function to call when the processing is finished. It pushes the output files back into the gulp stream.\n- `fileProps`: An object with some information about the files that have been written to the temp directory.\n    - `fileProps.cwd`: The original vinyl CWD.\n\n#### Notes\n\nThe files are written to `tempDir` using the vinyl file object's relative path, just like `gulp.dest()` writes to the output directory. Make sure you understand how globbing works to avoid unexpected errors: for example, the files in `gulp.src(['files/*.json', config.yml])` will all be output at the root of `tempDir`. \n\nConsider passing the [`{ base: '.' }` option to `glob.src`](https://github.com/wearefractal/glob-stream#options) if you need to output a src glob as it exists on disk. When in doubt, log `tempDir` to the console and open it to see what's going on.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) © [Rob Wierzbowski](http://robwierzbowski.com)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"robwierzbowski","email":"hello@robwierzbowski.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-07-27T22:38:45.292Z","created":"2014-06-03T03:26:16.262Z","0.1.0":"2014-06-03T03:26:16.262Z","0.1.1":"2014-06-11T03:14:54.658Z","0.1.2":"2014-06-11T03:48:04.389Z","0.1.3":"2014-06-12T00:31:09.006Z","0.1.4":"2014-06-12T03:39:32.723Z","0.1.5":"2014-06-12T03:57:16.909Z","0.1.6":"2014-06-13T03:21:41.622Z","1.0.0":"2014-06-27T03:00:11.899Z","1.1.0":"2014-06-28T20:55:35.830Z","1.2.0":"2014-07-01T22:30:43.793Z","2.0.0":"2014-07-01T22:40:27.772Z","2.0.1":"2014-07-09T02:53:55.880Z","3.0.0":"2014-07-21T00:36:17.378Z","3.0.1":"2014-07-27T22:38:45.292Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/robwierzbowski/gulp-intermediate","keywords":["gulpplugin","gulp","intermediate","filesystem"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/robwierzbowski/gulp-intermediate"},"author":{"name":"Rob Wierzbowski","email":" hello@robwierzbowski.com","url":"http://robwierzbowski.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/robwierzbowski/gulp-intermediate/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"readme.md","users":{"alexisjanvier":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"2BWUD7SWTTKTWEN1KH2RV61R1\""}
